# cross-synchrony
Alternative method to quantify the synchrony of the system through information geometry.

Here, I would like to an alternative method to quantify the synchrony of a system known as **Cross Synchrony Entropy (CSE)**. In general, the synchrony of a system can be quantified by **Global Field Synchronization (GFS)** which able to quantify the synchrony of the system at a specific frequency. Hence, it may not work well when utilizing it to a range of frequency (e.g. EEG alpha bands (8-16Hz)). This is because one needs average the GFS after evaluate the GFS for all the frequencies within the frequency band which the average value would vary depending on the interested interval when evaluating GFS. Higher interval (e.g. 1Hz) would allow the
