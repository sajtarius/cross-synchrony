# cross-synchrony
Alternative method to quantify the synchrony of the system through information geometry.

Here, I would like to an alternative method to quantify the synchrony of a system through signals known as **Cross Synchrony Entropy (CSE)**. In general, the synchrony of a system can be quantified by **Global Field Synchronization (GFS)** which able to quantify the synchrony of the system at a specific frequency. Hence, it may not work well when utilizing it to a range of frequency (e.g. EEG alpha bands (8-16Hz)). This is because one needs average the GFS after evaluate the GFS for all the frequencies within the frequency band which the average value would vary depending on the interested interval when evaluating GFS. Higher frequency interval (e.g. 1Hz) would not able to get a proper GFS of the interested frequency range. On the other hand, lower frequency intervel (e.g. 0.1Hz) would subsequently increase the computation time. 

To overcome the state problem, here I evaluate the synchrony through the phase difference between the signals at a interested frequency range. This can be achieved by evaluating the angle different between the analytic signals. The analytic signal is a series of complex number signal which can be obtained after going through Hilbert transform. The angle different is evaluated with **cosine** (e.g. $cos(\Delta \theta)$)
